Software Engineering - the Acme Way

# Response for #6

* Ran auto pep8 on all my files. Didn't change very much style-wise!

Part 7 - Questions (and your Answers)

# Response for #7 / Part 1 

* There many aspects to code that I pay attention, but most importantly it's the logic and readability of it. 
Was it verbose? Was it too black-box (lacked detail)? These are very important things to pay attention to. 
In addition, variable names, I'm learning how important it is to logically name the variables and their function 
in the code. 


We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with slightly different things running on 
all of them. How could containers help us improve this situation? Docker can run their own environments they are 
separate from the operating system.

# Response for #7 / Part 2 

* Docker is becoming an industry standard for the current state of the web / integrated multi-screen experiences, 
because of its speed, efficiency, and reproduceability. Rather than needing VM software, an actual instance of an 
operating system, this can all be mimicked with the notion of a Docker container. This container can be run on any 
system with minimal resources of the local device utilizing docker. This has many advantages in an ecosystem with so 
many varying levels of computing power (desktop machine vs an old iPhone). More applications can be distributed with 
less physical servers for more users!
