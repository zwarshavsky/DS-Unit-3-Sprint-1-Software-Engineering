Data Science Unit 3 Sprint Challenge 1
Software Engineering - the Acme Way
In this sprint challenge you will write code and answer questions related to object-oriented programming, code style/reviews, containers, and testing. You may use any tools and references you wish, but your final code should reflect your work and be saved in .py files (not notebooks), and (along with this file including your written answers) added to your DS-Unit-3-Sprint-1-Software-Engineering repository.

For all your code, you may only import/use the following:

Other modules you write
unittest (from the standard library)
random (from the standard library)
As always, make sure to manage your time - get a section/question to "good enough" and then move on to make sure you do everything. You can always revisit and polish at the end if time allows.

This file is Markdown, so it may be helpful to add/commit/push it first so you can view it all nice and rendered on GitHub.

Good luck!

Part 1 - Keeping it Classy
As an employee of Acme Corporation, you're always looking for ways to better organize the vast quantities and variety of goods your company manages and sells. Everything Acme sells is considered a Product, and must have the following fields (variables that live "inside" the class):

name (string with no default)
price (integer with default value 10)
weight (integer with default value 20)
flammability (float with default value 0.5)
identifier (integer, automatically genererated as a random (uniform) number anywhere from 1000000 to 9999999, includisve)(inclusive).
Write a Python class to model the above data. Make sure you are precise in your field names and types, and that your class has an __init__ constructor method with appropriate defaults (or lack thereof).

Hint - random.randint should be able to serve your random number needs.

Save the class in acme.py, and you can test your code in a Python repl as follows:

>>> from acme import Product
>>> prod = Product('A Cool Toy')
>>> prod.name
'A Cool Toy'
>>> prod.price
10
>>> prod.weight
20
>>> prod.flammability
0.5
>>> prod.identifier
2812086  # your value will vary
Part 2 - Objects that Go!
The class you wrote in part 1 is nice, but it doesn't do anything - that is, it doesn't have any methods. So let's add some! Specifically, add two methods:

stealability(self) - calculates the price divided by the weight, and then returns a message: if the ratio is less than 0.5 return "Not so stealable...", if it is greater or equal to 0.5 but less than 1.0 return "Kinda stealable.", and otherwise return "Very stealable!"
explode(self) - calculates the flammability times the weight, and then returns a message: if the product is less than 10 return "...fizzle.", if it is greater or equal to 10 but less than 50 return "...boom!", and otherwise return "...BABOOM!!"
Save your code, and you can test as follows:

>>> from acme import Product
>>> prod = Product('A Cool Toy')
>>> prod.stealability()
'Kinda stealable.'
>>> prod.explode()
'...boom!'
Part 3 - A Proper Inheritance
Of course, Acme doesn't just sell generic products - it sells all sorts of special specific things!

Make a subclass of Product named BoxingGlove that does the following:

Change the default weight to 10 (but leave other defaults unchanged)
Override the explode method to always return "...it's a glove."
Add a punch method that returns "That tickles." if the weight is below 5, "Hey that hurt!" if the weight is greater or equal to 5 but less than 15, and "OUCH!" otherwise
Example test run:

>>> from acme import BoxingGlove
>>> glove = BoxingGlove('Punchy the Third')
>>> glove.price
10
>>> glove.weight
10
>>> glove.punch()
'Hey that hurt!'
>>> glove.explode()
"...it's a glove."
Part 4 - Class Report
Now you can represent your inventory - let's use these classes and write an acme_report.py module to generate random products and print a summary of them. For the purposes of these functions we will only use the Product class.

Your module should include two functions:

generate_products() should generate a given number of products (default 30), randomly, and return them as a list
inventory_report() takes a list of products, and prints a "nice" summary
For the purposes of generation, "random" means uniform - all possible values should vary uniformly across the following possibilities:

name should be a random adjective from ['Awesome', 'Shiny', 'Impressive', 'Portable', 'Improved'] followed by a space and then a random noun from ['Anvil', 'Catapult' 'Disguise' 'Mousetrap', '???'], e.g. 'Awesome Anvil' and Portable Catapult' are both possible
price and weight should both be from 5 to 100 (inclusive and independent, and remember - they're integers!)
flammability should be from 0.0 to 2.5 (floats)
You should implement only depending on random from the standard library, your Product class from acme.py, and built-in Python functionality.

For the report, you should calculate and print the following values:

Number of unique product names in the product list
Average (mean) price, weight, and flammability of listed products
At the bottom of acme_report.py you should put the following code:

Following is useful starting code for acme_repory.py:

#!/usr/bin/env python

from random import randint, sample, uniform
from acme import Product

# Useful to use with random.sample to generate names
ADJECTIVES = ['Awesome', 'Shiny', 'Impressive', 'Portable', 'Improved']
NOUNS = ['Anvil', 'Catapult', 'Disguise', 'Mousetrap', '???']


def generate_products(num_products=30):
    products = []
    # TODO - your code! Generate and add random products.
    return products


def inventory_report(products):
    pass  # TODO - your code! Loop over the products to calculate the report.


if __name__ == '__main__':
    inventory_report(generate_products())
The last lines let you test by running python acme_report.py. You should see output like:

$ python acme_report.py
ACME CORPORATION OFFICIAL INVENTORY REPORT
Unique product names: 19
Average price: 56.8
Average weight: 54.166666666666664
Average flammability: 1.258097155966675
It's OK for the specifics to vary (how you message/format), but it should output and clearly identify all four relevant numbers.

Part 5 - Measure twice, Test once
Make a file acme_test.py starting from the following code:

#!/usr/bin/env python

import unittest
from acme import Product
from acme_report import generate_products, ADJECTIVES, NOUNS


class AcmeProductTests(unittest.TestCase):
    """Making sure Acme products are the tops!"""
    def test_default_product_price(self):
        """Test default product price being 10."""
        prod = Product('Test Product')
        self.assertEqual(prod.price, 10)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
If you run the tests you should see output like:

$ python acme_test.py
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK
Complete the following:

Add at least 2 more test methods to AcmeProductTests for the base Product class: at least 1 that tests default values (as shown), and one that builds an object with different values and ensures their stealability() and explode() methods function as they should
Write a new test class AcmeReportTests with at least 2 test methods: test_default_num_products which checks that it really does receive a list of length 30, and test_legal_names which checks that the generated names for a default batch of products are all valid possible names to generate (adjective, space, noun, from the lists of possible words)
Hint - test_legal_names is the trickiest of these, but may not be as bad as you think. Check out assertIn from unittest, and remember that Python is pretty handy at string processing. But if you get stuck, move on and revisit.

Note that inventory_report() is pretty tricky to test, because it doesn't return anything - it just prints (a "side-effect"). For the purposes of this challenge, don't worry about testing it - but as a stretch goal/something to think about, it's a good ponderer.

Part 6 - Style it Up
If you did the earlier parts in an editor that was linting your code (warning you about violations of PEP8 style) and you listened to it, you're already done!

If not, go back and fix things! If you don't have a built-in tool for checking, you can use PEP8 online.

Go for lint-free! If there's a stubborn warning or two you can't fix though, it's okay to leave a comment explaining it and move on.

Part 7 - Questions (and your Answers)
Acme Corporation isn't just a few .py files. If you want to grow in your career here, you'll have to answer the following:

What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate when others do the same for your code?

Answer: Something that is so important for me in the name of the variable, function methods or classes must be intuitive for everybody. Secondly, the organization of the files in the folder, design different classes and classes for each part of the code, don't mix everything in one function

We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us improve this situation? Docker can run their own environments they are separate from the operating system.

Answer: One person can create an environment with all libraries and packages that are necessary for run a code and other people just need to access and pull that environment and run it in their own machines.

Answer both of these questions (baseline ~5 sentences) here in text.

Part 8 - Turn it in!
Add all the files you wrote (acme.py, acme_report.py, and acme_test.py), as well as this file with your answers to part 7, to your weekly repo (DS-Unit-3-Sprint-1-Software-Engineering). Commit, push, and await feedback from Acme Corporation management. Thanks for your hard work!

Bonus! Got this far? Read up on the history of the fine Acme Corporation, with decades of quality products and many satisfied customers (mostly coyotes).
